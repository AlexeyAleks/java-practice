The Captive.
A captive, alone in a dungeon I dwell,
Entombed in the stillness and murk of a cell.
Outside, in the courtyard, in wild, frenzied play,
My comrade, an eagle, has pounced on his prey.

Then, leaving the blood-spattered morsel, his eye,
He fixes on me with a dolorous cry,
A cry that is more like a call or a plea-
"'Tis time," he is saying, "'tis time, let us flee!

"We're both wed to freedom, so let us away
To where lonely storm-clouds courageously stray,
Where turbulent seas rush to merge with the sky,
Where only the winds dare to venture and I!..."
